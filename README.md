# Website Issues

This is only for issues with the site. Don't post an issue about API issues or the site being down.
We have a repo for API issues and a status page for checking what is going on with the site.

We may remove your issues at any moment if you post anything that shouldn't be placed here and we reserve the right to do so without warning at our discretion.
